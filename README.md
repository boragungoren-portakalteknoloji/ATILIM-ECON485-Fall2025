*ECON 485 - Introduction to Database Systems* 
*Fall 2025*

This course provides an introduction to database systems using SQL and such languages. Therefore, these achievements during the course helps students to handle big data and complex data structures.

There are three major approaches to this type of course:
- The computer science approach focuses on the students gaining skills to design and implement databases, which means the students should learn a lot on theory, design and implementation of database systems themselves, and SQL to some extent. Students are expected to use skills from data and file structures, as well as many algorithms to solve hard problems.
- The DB administrator & developer approach focuses on the students gaining practical skills in developing database connected software applications. This means the students focus on one particular database management system (MySQL, Oracle, etc) and heavy use of SQL. Students are expected to deploy software, code in languages such as Python or Java, and solve complex technical problems.
- The DB analyst approach focuses on the students gaining skills in analyzing business processes and identifying parts where databases will be used. This approach requires the students to learn some degree of theory and some degree of SQL, albeit not in depth. However, other skills in analysis and assignments that merge technical and non-technical tasks take time in the course.
T
his course uses the DB analyst approach.

Another important recent topic is the use of AI in database related work. In early cases this has been limited to asking an AI LLM to create SQL statements, or perform simple DB design tasks.

However, over the last years, an increasing number of tools have appeared and their use has been wide-spread. From the DB analyst point of view, it is now part of modern tool set. So this course will cover some of the better performing tools. Using AI tools also has some drawbacks, and with each tool those drawbacks will also be covered.

Therefore this course is a modern AI augmented approach to modern databases from a DB Analyst point of view.
- The course employs fail-forward framing: AI errors are part of the learning. Students shouldn’t feel punished for relying on AI — the grade will reward their fixes and reflections.
- Questions on AI augmentation. – Exams will also include questions on AI use.
